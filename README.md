# Research-Papers
List of all research papers I have read.
This place is to remind me of my progress in the DL realm.

Keep asking yourself:\
1. What author is trying to accomplish\
2. What you can use of it\
3. What are key elements\
4. What other references you want to follow\

Depending on importance go to higher level:\
Level 1: Read title, abstract and figures\
Level 2: Read intro, Conclusion and skip related work section\
Level 3: Read Medium or other articles or blogs\
Level 4: Read some sections of it\
Level 5: Read some more sections of it\
Level 6: Implement completely or partially in a project\
Level 7: Read thoroughly and understood ccompletely
